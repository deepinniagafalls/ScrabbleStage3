Group Meeting on 5/1/15


What we accomplished today:
-Fixed the multipliers so that they accurately alter the point value of a letter/word. Player's scores are now updated to reflect this change.
-Made some fundamental changes to the organization/structure of our code to hopefully separate the functionality of our model from the GUI. 


-The meeting lasted approximately 5.5 hours.
